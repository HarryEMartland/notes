#### Notes

- None one needs to look at logs they are there for forensic purposes
- N + 2, during a release one service will go down (leaving N + 1) and during that time another service might fail (still leaving N)
- Up to a certain point customers cannot tell the diference between between reliability and reliability comes with cost
- It sounds like SRE is like a product owner for reliablility

#### Deffinitions

- *Sparse* - Thinly Dispersed or Scattered
- *Dogmatic* - People who wont change their mind
